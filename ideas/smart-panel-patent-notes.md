# Smart Electrical Panel - Patent Research Notes

## Innovation Summary
Computer-controlled residential electrical distribution system replacing traditional breaker panels

## Key Differentiators from Existing Systems
- Residential focus (commercial systems already exist)
- Trunk line architecture vs individual circuits
- Pre-terminated modular connections
- Factory integration for automated housing
- Normally-open fail-safe design

## Prior Art to Research
- Commercial building automation patents
- Smart electrical panel systems
- Distributed power control
- Modular electrical systems

## Search Terms for USPTO/Google Patents
- "smart electrical panel"
- "distributed power control"  
- "modular electrical system"
- "residential electrical automation"
- "centralized arc detection"

## Technical Challenges Documented
- DC vs AC home wiring (future consideration)
- Centralized vs distributed monitoring
- Module cost vs functionality tradeoff
- Custom switch/receptacle design
- Control wire routing (Cat5 vs wireless)

## Development Status
- Concept fully mapped (details temporarily lost - word retrieval issues)
- Put on back burner for SimpleBook priority
- Requires less capital than other automation ideas
- Physical prototype possible without programming initially

## Integration with Other Projects
- Pre-wired wall panels for CNC manufacturing
- Automated truss production
- Complete factory-built housing units
- Mobile home park applications
