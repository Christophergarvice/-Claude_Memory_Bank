# December 13, 2025 - Raspberry Pi Setup & Electrical System Ideas

## Raspberry Pi 4 Memory System
- Ordered CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) - arrives Monday
- Purpose: GitHub-based memory system for AI conversation continuity
- Setup: Public repo, automated sync, session summaries
- Fixes Opus memory loss issue that caused module rebuilding

## Smart Electrical Panel Innovation (Patent Potential)

### Core Concept
Replace traditional breaker panels with computer-controlled distribution system:
- Single main feed from utility (required code compliance)
- Large trunk line (like plumbing) through house instead of individual home runs
- Smart tap-off modules with low-voltage control
- Pre-terminated connections (plug-and-play circuits)
- Normally-open relays for fail-safe design

### Key Advantages
- Eliminates expensive arc fault breakers ($60-80 each)
- Centralized arc detection and monitoring
- Individual circuit isolation (not whole panel shutdown)
- Massive labor savings (no home runs to pull)
- Less copper required
- Factory-friendly for automated housing

### Control System
- Python-based monitoring (continuity, arc detection)
- Cat5 or small copper wire for control signals
- Real-time load monitoring feedback
- Could expand to wireless in some cases

### Manufacturing Integration
- Designed for pre-wired wall panel production
- Enables factory automation of complete homes
- Custom switches/receptacles with faster termination
- Supports 16x48 mobile home unit construction

### Patent Status
- Some similar commercial systems exist
- Residential application may be open territory
- Need USPTO/Google Patents search
- Should document fully before pursuing

### Related Projects
- CNC truss automation (15 mobile home roofs = immediate ROI)
- Automated wall panel manufacturing
- Complete factory-built rental units
- Construction automation exit strategy

## Business Goals
- Current: $25k/month rental income (breaks even)
- Target: $50k/month (profit margin inflection point)
- SimpleBook tracking essential for ROI analysis
- Long-term: Automated housing production

## Next Steps
1. Set up Pi memory system (Monday)
2. Document electrical ideas before terminology lost
3. Fix SimpleBook parser bug
4. Continue CNC hardware research (steppers, controllers)
